# Conway's Game of Life RGB GTKMM

## Description:
An implementation of Conways game of life that 
supports parallel processing. Essentially there are 24 of these
games running at the same time. 8 games per channel with 3 
total channels. OpenCL Will be targeted for atomic values.

## Purpose:
Conway's Game of Life RGB is designed to be 
my first GUI application and demonstrate proper C++
coding techniques such as OOP, memory management, 
polymorphism, and general knowledge.

## Notes:
Program uses GTKMM.
